    <h1>FireFighter Bot</h1>
    <section>
        <h2>Project Overview</h2>
        <p>
            I built this in highschool for my grade 12 engineering class. The FireFighter bot is an autonomous robot designed to navigate a maze and locate the fire source, which in our case was a candle. Once the fire source is detected by the IR sensors, the robot activates the fan to blow out the flame. The project involves integrating various sensors, such as flame sensors and ultrasonic sensors, to enable the robot to detect walls and the fire source effectively.

    <h2>Documentation</h2>
    <section>
        <p>Part 1: Before starting on our project, we had to complete 10 different breadboarding assignments, all designed to help us understand logic gates, binary clocks, etc. In this, I was exposed to building circuits from looking at schematic diagrams, which built my foundation for the more complex work ahead. I became skilled with a multimeter, troubleshooting issues like bad connections and short circuits to ensure each circuit functioned as intended. Then, my partner and I wrote up a document explaining our project, including a deatiled sketch, materials list and project calender to be evaluated by our teacher and prepare us for future workplaces.</p>

    <section>
        <p> Part 2: Now that the basics were done, we were given another schematic diagram that we had to translate onto a printed circuit board, designed using Traxmaker Pro. Taught me greatly about how to make circuits more efficent now that I couldnt have wires jumping over each other to get it running. </p>

    </section>
    <section>
        <p>Part 3: Once the PCB designs were approved, it was printed onto a photosensitive copper-clad laminate using UV light exposure, then put into an ethching tank to remove excess copper and reveal the final circuit pathways. We then drilled small openings to solder our components in. During this time, we also built the frame of the bot, and lucked out by finding threaded lamp rods that had a shell in which we could run wire through. This decluttered the bot making the PCB boards clearer to see/easier to troubleshoot and the bot more visually appealing.</p>

    <section>
        <p>Part 4: Now that we had everything set up, we connected the PCB's to power and started troubleshooting, because as is the way with engineering, nothing ever goes right the first time. Started form basics such as getting the motors running, getting the wall sensors to detect objects and output the vlaues in the LCD, to finally getting the IR sensors to detect the flame and turn the fan on. Through this, we had to constantly troubleshoot the circuitry using a multimeter, resolder some parts and lines, and replace componenets that weren't working. </p>
        </section>
    <section>
        <p>Part 5: Once everything was working individually, we were finally ready to start testing the bot in the maze. The aim was to successfully navigate the maze, detect the flame and blow it out with the fan. The algorithim was coded use GCBasic. Lots of trial and error, as well as troubleshooting circuitry and resoldering. We got it to detect the flame in the end!! Overall, this project taught me a lot about PCB design, microcontroller programming, sensor integration and autonomous navigation algorithms. It was a challenging but rewarding experience that helped me develop my skills in mechatronics engineering.</p>

        <p>Final Thoughts: This project was a great learning experience that taught me valuable skills in PCB design, microcontroller programming, sensor integration, and autonomous navigation algorithms. It also highlighted the importance of teamwork and effective communication in successfully completing a complex engineering project. Overall, I am proud of what my partner and I accomplished with the FireFighter Bot and look forward to applying these skills in future mechatronics projects.</p>
